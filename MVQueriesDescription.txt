<CompanyExplanation>
-Maids.cc is a UAE-based company specializing in providing domestic workers (maids) to clients. It offers flexible services that allow clients to customize their hiring contracts, ensuring high satisfaction and convenience.
-The process begins when a client signs a CC contract with Maids.cc, allowing flexibility in selecting and changing maids until they find the ideal match. Once satisfied with a particular maid, clients can switch to an MV contract, a long-term arrangement between the client and the chosen domestic worker.
-The MV service provides clients with dedicated, long-term household support. This structure promotes stability in placements and allows a seamless transition from CC to MV for long-term arrangements with the selected maid.
-MV operations track key actions such as new placements and cancellations, recording details such as the maid’s nationality, unique contract IDs, and action dates. This structure supports efficient client interactions and accurate data monitoring throughout the hiring process.
